        <h3>Dashboards and Data Visualization</h3>

        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p>
            Dashboards tell a visual story about one or more business processes or services by presenting multiple widgets or data visualizations together in a single display.
        </p>

        <h4>Core UI Dashboards vs Next Experience Dashboards</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Core UI dashboards are created in the classic UI using Report Designer and PA widgets.</li>
            <li>Next Experience Dashboards (Platform Analytics Experience) offer a unified interface for visualizing data from multiple sources.</li>
            <li>When <i>com.glide.par.unified_analytics.enabled</i> property is enabled, both dashboard types coexist and can be shared.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Platform Analytics Experience</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The Platform Analytics Experience consists of two main sections:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Analytics Center</b> – Displays bookmarked and certified dashboards and visualizations; includes Analytics Q/A for natural language queries.</li>
                    <li><b>Library</b> – Stores all analytics components like dashboards, data visualizations, indicators, filters, and scheduled exports.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Dashboards in Analytics Center</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Dashboards are created, populated, shared, and viewed in the Dashboards module.</li>
            <li>Dashboards can be created both from the Analytics Center or Library sections.</li>
            <li>Use the in-line editor dashboard type for most common user dashboards.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Creating a Next Experience Dashboard</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Navigate to All > Platform Analytics > Library > Dashboards.</li>
            <li>Select Create new dashboard action and choose In-line editor type.</li>
            <li>Enter a Name and Description (example: Name: Incident Insights, Description: Incident Operations Metrics).</li>
            <li>Select Create to open a blank dashboard canvas.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Dashboard UI and Layout Controls</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Dashboard Layout Controls appear in Edit mode; they allow you to update the dashboard name and add tabs.</li>
            <li>The Dashboard Action Menu in the upper-right corner lets you add elements to the dashboard.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Elements You Can Add to a Dashboard</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Data Visualizations</b> – Graphical representation of instance data or imported data.</li>
            <li><b>Filters</b> – Enable users to filter visualizations based on specific criteria.</li>
            <li><b>Filter Group</b> – Apply a set of filters to multiple visualizations simultaneously.</li>
            <li><b>Headings</b> – Add text at the top of a dashboard or section.</li>
            <li><b>Image Elements</b> – Hold static or animated images.</li>
            <li><b>Simple Lists</b> – Display table data customized for the dashboard audience.</li>
            <li><b>Process Mining – Map</b> – Shows different process states and transitions.</li>
            <li><b>Rich Text Elements</b> – Display text formatted as HTML or plain text, including fonts, size, and links.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            This module focuses on building dashboards and data visualizations in the Platform Analytics Experience to help users analyze and share insights effectively.
        </p>

        <h3>Managing Dashboards</h3>

        <h4>Dashboard Controls</h4>
        <p>
            Dashboard Controls are actions that manage the dashboard, both during and after configuration.
        </p>

        <h4>Working with Dashboards</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>As you make changes, periodically select <b>Save</b>.</li>
            <li>After editing, select <b>Exit Editing Mode</b> to preview the dashboard.</li>
            <li>Saved dashboards appear under the <b>Owned by me</b> filter in the Dashboards tab.</li>
            <li>The <b>Bookmark this dashboard</b> option adds the dashboard to the Bookmarked filter for quick access.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Manage Dashboard Details</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Select the <b>Information (i)</b> icon on an open dashboard to view details like Name, Description, and Visibility.</li>
            <li>To make changes to details, switch the dashboard into Edit mode.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Sharing a Dashboard</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Use the <b>Share</b> option in the dashboard ellipse menu to manage access.</li>
            <li>Dashboards can be shared with users, groups, or specified roles.</li>
            <li>Access levels include <b>View</b> and <b>Edit</b>. You can also allow users to share the dashboard with others.</li>
            <li>If you have access to someone else’s dashboard, it will appear under the <b>All</b> filter in the Dashboards tab.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Effective management of dashboards ensures that insights are accessible to the right users while maintaining control over content and updates.
