        <h3>What is Platform Analytics?</h3>
        <h4>
            Centralize performance analytics, user experience analytics, and reporting in one location. Share actionable insights quickly and easily. 
            <li>Anticipate trends, prioritize resources, and continuously improve with real-time analytics.</li>
            <li>Create on-demand reports using a single data model for instant, up-to-date insights.</li>
            <li>Uncover trends and patterns using in-platform process mining.</li>
        </h4>
        
        <h3>Examples of Analytics</h3>
        <h4>
            Platform Analytics ships with pre-configured Dashboards and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) tailored to support a variety of processes. Below are some examples of Dashboards targeting different process stakeholders.
            <li>The Incident Management Dashboard provides analytics on incident volume, state, category, priority, resolution rates, etc., and organizes the information by incident State.</li>
            <li>The Virtual Agent Overview Dashboard provides analytics on conversations, their completion status and duration, topics, channels, and users.</li>
            <li>The Vulnerability Analytics Dashboard provides an executive view into vulnerabilities and vulnerable items, helping the Vulnerability Admin pinpoint areas of concern quickly.</li>
            <li>The HR Executive Dashboard provides accountability, progress, performance metrics, and status of HR cases.</li>
        </h4>

        <h3>What is Really Needed?</h3>
        <h4>
            <li>Metrics clearly connected to goals that matter to the Glide Haven leadership and stakeholders.</li>
            <li>Dashboards that provide actionable information.</li>
            <li>Analytics within the context of a process or a workflow supporting daily actions and behavior.</li>
            <li>Dashboards and visualizations designed to tell a clear story, tailored for the needs of the audience.</li>
        </h4>

         <h3>Key Insight</h3>
        <h4>
            Visualize actionable KPIs that tell the story of your business process and display the right level of information to their intended viewers.
        </h4>

        <h3>Table Queries:</h3>
        <h4>
            <li>Return a data summary measured at a specific time. It describes a process at the current moment.</li>
            <li>Measure process outputs when no historical Trend is required.</li>
            <li>Provide real-time status updates and summaries of past information.</li>
        </h4>

        <h3>Analytics Trend:</h3>
        <h4>
            <li>Presents a series of measurements collected over time. The Trend describes how a process has changed and evolved over a period of time.</li>
            <li>Visualizes performance Trends against targets and uses notifications. This allows a Process Owner to take action as soon as performance degradation is detected.</li>
            <li>Provides the ability to correlate multiple business processes and derive new metrics.</li>
            <li>Example: What is the percentage of Critical incidents not worked on in the last 24 hours?</li>
        </h4>
        
        <h3>Architecture and Components</h3>
        <p>
            Trust the process...  
            The ServiceNow implementation team at Glide Haven is on a mission to educate its stakeholders on the application's architecture and data flow so that stakeholders trust the data visualizations and can accurately state new requirements or request configuration changes.

        <h3>Key Platform Analytics Objects</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Indicator (KPI)</b>
                <p>
                    Defines a specific measurement you can count or calculate to assess process performance and forecast future trends.  
                    Example: The <i>Number of open incidents</i> indicator returns a count of all open incidents.
                </p>

            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Breakdown</b>
                <p>
                    The ability to group (breakdown) indicator scores by a qualitative attribute, such as Priority, Category, or Assignment Group.  
                    Example: The <i>Priority breakdown</i> applied to the Number of open incidents indicator shows performance across all incident prioritiesâ€”Planning, Low, Moderate, High, and Critical.
                </p>

            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Data Collector</b>
                <p>
                    The engine that takes periodic snapshots of your process tables and stores them in the Scores and Snapshots tables for performance analysis.  
                    Example: The <i>[PA Incident] Daily Data Collection</i> job runs daily and populates data for multiple indicators, retrieving the right set of records from the incident table.
                </p>

            </li>

            <li>
                <b>KPI Details</b>
                <p>
                    An exploratory view of indicator results used for detailed analysis. It lets you see trends, predictions, breakdowns, and the associated records for a specific indicator.  
                    Example: The <i>% of incidents resolved by first assigned group</i> KPI details allow you to scrutinize all indicator data collected so far.
                </p>

            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Data Visualization</b>
                <p>
                    A reusable view of indicator scores that can present data as a single value, a historical trend chart, or one of many other visualizations. These can be arranged on the dashboard canvas.  
                    Example: A visualization displays <i>Number of open incidents</i> as a Time Series trend.
                </p>
 
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Next Experience Dashboard</b>
                <p>
                    A collection of visualizations that describe a process or service behavior and target a specific audience.  
                    Example: The <i>Incident Management Dashboard</i> contains Incident-related visualizations (single score, breakdown, scorecard, etc.) organized in tabs to give a full picture of the Incident Management process.
                </p>
