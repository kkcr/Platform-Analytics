        <h3>Data Collection</h3>
        <p>
            Data Collection is the process that enables the visualization of KPIs in Data Visualizations and Next Experience Dashboards. 
            It provides the foundation for accurate trend analysis by capturing business process performance over time.
        </p>

        <b>How Does Data Collection Work?</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Generates periodic snapshots of business process records to build accurate process trends.</li>
            <li>Retrieves Indicator Scores from process tables by running regularly scheduled jobs.</li>
            <li>Jobs calculate Indicator Scores and store them in dedicated score tables.</li>
            <li>Platform Analytics visualizations use these score tables to display trends in dashboards.</li>
        </ul>

        <b>Four-Step Process Overview</b>
        <ol>
            <li>Platform Analytics data and business process data coexist within the same ServiceNow instance.</li>
            <li>Data Collection jobs run on schedule to retrieve process records.</li>
            <li>Indicator Scores are calculated and stored in Platform Analytics score tables.</li>
            <li>Dashboards and visualizations display the collected scores as trends and KPIs.</li>
        </ol>

        <b>Core PA Data Tables</b>
        <p>Indicator Scores are stored across multiple tables depending on breakdown levels:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Snapshots [pa_snapshots]</b> – Stores record sys_ids.</li>
            <li><b>Scores Level 1 [pa_scores_l1]</b> – Stores scores for indicators and 1st-level breakdowns.</li>
            <li><b>Scores Level 2 [pa_scores_l2]</b> – Stores scores for 2nd-level breakdowns.</li>
        </ul>

        <b>Types of Data Sources in Platform Analytics</b>
        <p>Data for Indicators comes from several sources that drive analytics:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Indicators (KPI)</b>
                <p>Define the measurement you want to track or calculate to assess process performance. Example: <i>Number of open incidents</i>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Breakdowns</b>
                <p>Allow grouping of indicator results by qualitative attributes such as Priority, Category, or Assignment Group. Example: <i>Priority breakdown of open incidents</i>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Data Collectors</b>
                <p>Scheduled jobs that read process tables and populate the Score and Snapshot tables. Example: <i>[PA Incident] Daily Data Collection job</i>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Automated Indicators</b>
                <p>Pre-configured indicators that are calculated automatically based on defined rules and data sources.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>External Data Sources</b>
                <p>Data imported from outside systems to enrich analytics or supplement internal process tables.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Text Analytics</b>
                <p>Use natural language processing to extract KPIs from unstructured text data, such as incident descriptions or user feedback.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            These data sources work together to ensure that Platform Analytics provides accurate, up-to-date, and actionable insights.
