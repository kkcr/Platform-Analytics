        <h3>Targets and Thresholds</h3>
        <p>
            Targets and Thresholds help monitor and improve business process performance by setting goals and alerting on deviations.
        </p>

        <h4>Targets Overview</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Targets define quantifiable goals for Indicators, providing context and direction for process improvement.</li>
            <li>Targets can be Personal (visible only to the user) or Global (visible to all users).</li>
            <li>Target creation requires:
                <ul>
                    <li>Target Type (For me / For everyone)</li>
                    <li>Target Value</li>
                    <li>Target Start Date</li>
                    <li>Target Review Date</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Enable the Targets chart option in KPI Details to view existing Targets.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Managing Targets</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Personal Targets: Users can create their own targets only visible to them.</li>
            <li>Global Targets: Can be created only by users with roles pa_target_admin, pa_admin, or pa_power_user.</li>
            <li>The Target Gap shows the difference between the Indicator Score and the Target and is color-coded based on Indicator Direction.</li>
            <li>Target Color Schemes define colors for different levels of deviation. Examples include:
                <ul>
                    <li>5-color scheme: Bright Red, Dark Red, Orange, Light Green, Dark Green</li>
                    <li>3-color scheme: Customizable for simpler visual guidance</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Improvement over Baseline</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Automatic Target Calculation can set targets as an improvement over baseline values.</li>
            <li>Choose calculation parameters:
                <ul>
                    <li>Measured as Percentage or Units</li>
                    <li>Average of shown scores or existing target</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Indicator Direction determines whether improvement is added or subtracted.</li>
            <li>Examples:
                <ul>
                    <li>Existing target: 200, 10% improvement → New target = 180</li>
                    <li>Existing target: 200, 10 Units improvement → New target = 190</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Targets can be manually adjusted after automatic calculation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Thresholds Overview</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Thresholds notify when an Indicator is approaching specific conditions for early detection of unusual or critical behavior.</li>
            <li>Thresholds can be Personal (visible only to the owner) or Global (visible to all, with notifications sent to added users).</li>
            <li>Different types of Thresholds can be defined based on business requirements.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Notifications for Targets and Thresholds</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Notifications are sent automatically when Targets or Thresholds are reached.</li>
            <li>Add users to the Users Related List in the Target or Threshold form to receive notifications.</li>
            <li>Personal Thresholds/Targets automatically notify the owner if subscribed.</li>
            <li>Users can manage their notification subscriptions under User Preferences → Notifications → Advanced Preferences.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Proper use of Targets and Thresholds ensures measurable goals are tracked and deviations are promptly addressed, helping drive continuous process improvement.
