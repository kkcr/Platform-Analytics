        <h3>Automated Indicator Configuration</h3>
        <p>
            An <b>Automated Indicator</b> is based on three key elements: <b>Indicator Source, Aggregate,</b> and optionally <b>Additional Conditions</b>.
        </p>

        <h4>Indicator Source</h4>
        <p>
            The Indicator Source specifies the base table and high-level query. 
            <br>Example: <i>Incidents.Open</i> contains all incidents that are open and unresolved to date.
        </p>

        <h4>Aggregate</h4>
        <p>
            The Aggregate defines the operation applied to the Indicator Source data. Available aggregate functions include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Count:</b> Counts all records. Example: Number of Open Incidents.</li>
            <li><b>Distinct Count:</b> Counts distinct values. Example: Count distinct of Resolved Incident SLAs.</li>
            <li><b>Sum:</b> Sums values. Example: Sum of all Reassignments of Open Incident SLAs.</li>
            <li><b>Average:</b> Calculates the average. Example: Average Reassignment Count of Closed Changes.</li>
            <li><b>Minimum:</b> Returns the minimum value in the dataset.</li>
            <li><b>Maximum:</b> Returns the maximum value in the dataset.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Additional Conditions</h4>
        <p>
            Additional Conditions refine the data from the Indicator Source. 
            <br>Example: Apply the condition <i>Reassignment count > 0</i> to <i>Incidents.Open</i> to focus only on incidents that have been reassigned.
        </p>

        <h4>Summary</h4>
        <p>
            By configuring the Indicator Source, Aggregate, and Additional Conditions, Automated Indicators automatically calculate and track metrics over time, giving actionable insights into your process performance.
